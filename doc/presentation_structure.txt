# Prensentation

1. Introduction & Problem Statement (1-2 minutes)

   - Dataset overview: Lung cancer histopathological images
   - Binary classification task: adenocarcinoma vs benign
   - Project objectives

2. Data Preprocessing & Setup (2-3 minutes)

   - Dataset split methodology
   - Data augmentation decisions
   - Note about color vs grayscale (from your notes: "The model is learning the color of the class -> turning the image to gray scale")

3. Model Architectures (3-4 minutes)

   - CNN architecture details
   - ScatNet architecture
   - Classifier layer design (from your notes: "CNN is good at learning even with a small classifier layer" and "Scatnet needs more complex classifier layer")

4. Training & Evaluation (3-4 minutes)

   - K-fold cross-validation results
   - Performance metrics
   - Key findings (from your notes: "CNN reaches 99% accuracy" and "Scatnet reaches 92% accuracy")
   - Computational efficiency (from your notes: "CNN is faster than Scatnet")

5. Filter Analysis (2-3 minutes)

   - Comparison of filters from both models
   - Visual interpretation of learned features
   - Impact of data augmentation on filter quality

6. Explainable AI Results (2-3 minutes)

   - Implementation details of assigned XAI method
   - Comparison between custom implementation and Captum library
   - Attribution maps analysis

7. Conclusions (1-2 minutes)
   - Performance comparison summary
   - Key findings and insights


Each section should include relevant visualizations (learning curves, filters, attribution maps) to support the discussion, as specifically requested in the assignment instructions.
